                <h2>A Bit About Me</h2>
                <p>In 2019, I began my career as a mechanical engineer in the railway industry, gaining valuable experience at the locomotive depot in Tashkent. After a year, I transitioned to the Electronics Engineering department, starting my journey as an electronics engineer.</p>
<br/>
<p>With a strong passion for engineering, I aimed to expand my knowledge and skills. This ambition led me to the University of Liverpool's postgraduate program in 2022, where I received advanced training and insights.</p>
<br/>
<p>After completing my studies, I returned to my homeland and now work as an electronics engineer at the railway station in Samarkand.
                    Here, I apply my skills to improve the efficiency and reliability of our railway systems, always striving for innovation and excellence.</p>
