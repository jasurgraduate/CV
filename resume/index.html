                <h2>A Bit About Me</h2>
                <p>In 2019, I started my career as a mechanical engineer in the field of railway. I worked and gained experience at the locomotive depot in Tashkent. After a year, I got an offer from the department of Electronics Engineering. This is where my career as an electronics engineer started. However, I wanted to learn more about engineering. This is the reason why I applied to the postgraduate program at University of Liverpool in 2022. After finishing my course, nowadays I am back in my country and working as an electronics engineer at the railway station in Samarkand city.</p>
